[Lyrios, a Music Video Lyrical Experience](https://lyrios-music-frontend.herokuapp.com/)

### Purpose

##### Allows users to sign in using their google accounts and save their favorite music videos and lyrics (where available) into a backend for them to enjoy at their leisure.

### Approach

##### To come up with the application we used two APIs, a Google API for grabbing the music videos from YouTube as well as a lyrics api from Happi Dev. We understood that giving users the ability to save their videos required us to build Restful routing principles and full CRUD to have a functioning backend / front end experience. For the backend we relied on mongoose / mongodb to create the database, while for the front end we used Reactjs.

### Target Audience

##### Users of all ages looking to have a great music experience individually or amongts friends and family!
